# Introduction
This repository hosts the code for the first two deliverables of the subject.
The authors are:

- [Joan Palau Oncins](https://github.com/JoanPalau)
- [Josep Maria salvia Hornos](https://github.com/josalhor)

# First delivery contents
This is a quick overview of the functionality implemented. Further information about how does the algorithm work or pitfalls to avoid can be found inside the file **multiAgents.py**.

- Alpha-Beta (recursive) -> AlphaBetaAgent

- Expectimax (recursive) -> ExpectimaxAgent

- Evaluation function -> betterEvaluationFunction

- Mini-Max (iterative) -> IterativeMinimaxAgent

- Alpha-Beta (iterative) -> IterativeAlphaBetaAgent

The most challanging part has been fine tunning the evaluation function and developing the iterative versions of the algorithms as there were minuances that could be easily overseen causing the algorithms to not work as expected or be not as efficient as they could be.
